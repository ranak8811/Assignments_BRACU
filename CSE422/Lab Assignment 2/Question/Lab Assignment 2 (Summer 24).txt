CSE422: Artificial Intelligence [C02]
Lab Assignment 2


Part 1 [7 points]


Brac University plans to optimize its course scheduling for the upcoming academic semester. The university offers a variety of courses across different disciplines, each with specific scheduling requirements and constraints. The university needs to find a way to schedule its courses into a limited number of timeslots per day while ensuring that each course is scheduled exactly once and no timeslot has more than one course planned at the same time. 


You are tasked with optimizing the schedule for courses offered at Brac University using the popular Genetic Algorithm. 


Chromosome Representation (Encoding):
Each chromosome will be a binary string that encodes the schedule of courses across different timeslots. Here's how we will represent a chromosome:
* Length of the Chromosome: The length of a chromosome will be equal to , where  is the number of courses and  is the number of timeslots.
* Structure of the Chromosome: Each chromosome will be divided into  segments, where each segment will be of length . Each segment will represent a timeslot, and each bit within a segment will represent whether a particular course is scheduled in that timeslot.










Fitness Calculation:
   * The fitness function will evaluate each solution based on the number of course overlaps and consistency of a course.
   * The fitness function evaluates the quality of a schedule based on minimizing course overlaps and making sure a course is scheduled exactly once:

Here:
   * 
   * : ∑.

   * : 


Overlap Penalty:
      * For each timeslot, count the number of courses scheduled.
      * If more than one course is scheduled in the same timeslot, add a penalty equal to the number of extra courses.
Consistency Penalty:
      * For each course, check if it is scheduled exactly once.
      * If a course is not scheduled exactly once, add a penalty.






Task Breakdown:
      1. Model the course schedule array in a way suitable for the problem.
      2. Implement the fitness function that penalizes overlapping courses and ensures each course is scheduled exactly once.
      3. Choose two parents based on random selection for crossover. Show it as a separate function.  
      4. Perform single-point crossover to create 2 offspring from each pair of selected parents. Show it as a separate function. 
      5. Write the mutation function to introduce random changes.
      6. Create a population of randomly generated course schedules.
      7. Run genetic algorithms on the population until the highest fitness has been reached and/or the number of maximum iterations has been reached.


Input
The first line has a number  denoting the number of courses and a number T denoting the number of timeslots for a particular day. It will be followed by  lines each having a string that represents a course code that needs to be scheduled where, 
T>=N


[In this problem statement, we are considering that 1 course will have only 1 section]




Output
The output should be a binary string denoting 1 for scheduled courses and 0 for not scheduled courses in each timeslot. A string consisting of all zeros won’t be accepted. You also need to print the fitness value of the output string. 






Example:


Sample Input 
	3 3
CSE110
MAT110
PHY112
	Sample Output 
	110110010
-6
	Explanation
	Chromosome Representation
      * N×T=3×3=9
      * A chromosome of length 9 represents the schedule of courses across 3 timeslots.
      * Each timeslot is represented by a segment of length N=3.
Fitness Calculation
Let's take the output chromosome: 110110010
      * Timeslot 1: 110
      * CSE110: 1 (scheduled)
      * MAT110: 1 (scheduled)
      * PHY112: 0 (not scheduled)
      * Timeslot 2: 110
      * CSE110: 1 (scheduled)
      * MAT110: 1 (scheduled)
      * PHY112: 0 (not scheduled)
      * Timeslot 3: 010
      * CSE110: 0 (not scheduled)
      * MAT110: 1 (scheduled)
      * PHY112: 0 (not scheduled)
Interpretation of the Chromosome
      1. Timeslot 1: CSE110, MAT110 are scheduled.
      2. Timeslot 2: CSE110, MAT110 are scheduled.
      3. Timeslot 3: MAT110 is scheduled.
Penalty Calculation
Overlap Penalty:
      * Timeslot 1: 2 courses scheduled, penalty = 2−1=1
      * Timeslot 2: 2 courses scheduled, penalty = 2−1=1
      * Timeslot 3: 1 course scheduled, penalty = 1−1=0
      * Total overlap penalty = 1+1+0=2
Consistency Penalty:
      * CSE110: scheduled 2 times, penalty = ∣2−1∣=1
      * MAT110: scheduled 3 times, penalty = ∣3−1∣=2
      * PHY112: scheduled 0 times, penalty = ∣0−1∣=1
      * Total consistency penalty = 1+2+1=4
Total penalty = overlap penalty + consistency penalty = 2+4=6
Summary
      * Chromosome 110110010 results in a penalty of 6. So Fitness will be -6


	



















Part 2 [3 points]


For this part randomly select two parents from the initial population of your problem statement. Then perform a two-point crossover to generate two children. The two points have to be chosen randomly, but it has to be made sure the second point always comes after the first point. 


Here is an example of how two-point crossover works:
         Parent 1:  000111000
         Parent 2:  111000111


For two points crossover, we have randomly chosen the following points:      
1st point:-  between index 2 and index 3
2nd point:- between index 6 and index 7 


So the two resultant offsprings are, 000000100   &   111111011


[In this part, you just need to iterate once and print the resultant offspring after doing the crossover]




Part 3 [0 points]


In part 1, you selected parents through random sampling from the initial population. Another advanced technique for parent selection is known as Tournament Selection. Please take some time to research and understand this method at home. Might be helpful in the near future!
